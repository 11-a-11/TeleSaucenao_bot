# TeleSaucenao_bot
Search the origin of image through Telegram bot using SauceNao api(by Xamayon, https://saucenao.com). Telegram bot is connected through telebot by kosmodrey(https://github.com/kosmodrey/telebot).

# Preparation
- 1. Install node modules in package.json.
- 2. Get your own tokens from telegram bot and SauceNao(by Xamayon).
- 3. Make a directory "account" in the same depth with server.js and make 2 files "bot.js", and "saucenao.js" which contain each of tokens. Each file should be "module.exports = YOURTOKEN". Also, make a file with your telegram account id(num type) for report module of telebot in the same folder.
- Example
